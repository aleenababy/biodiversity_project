# Project Title: Endangered Species Analysis in National Parks

## Project Scope:

### Introduction:
- Provide background information on the National Parks Service and the significance of conserving endangered species within these parks.

### Objective:
- Perform data analysis on the conservation statuses of endangered species across different national parks.
- Investigate patterns or themes associated with species that become endangered.
- Analyze, clean up, and visualize data to identify meaningful insights and trends.

### Tasks:
1. Data Collection:
   - Gather data from the National Parks Service database on endangered species.
   - Acquire information on conservation statuses, species types, park locations, etc.

2. Data Analysis:
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
   - Identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
   - Analyze conservation statuses and species distributions across national parks.

3. Data Cleaning:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Standardize data formats and clean up data entries for accuracy.

4. Visualization:
   - Create visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent key findings.
   - Generate plots to visualize the distribution of endangered species across different parks.

5. Interpretation:
   - Interpret the findings from the data analysis to draw insights into endangered species conservation.
   - Identify any recurring patterns or themes regarding the types of species that become endangered.
   - Discuss the implications of these findings for conservation efforts within national parks.

6. Reporting:
   - Prepare a comprehensive report documenting the analysis process and findings.
   - Summarize key insights, trends, and conclusions drawn from the data.
   - Provide recommendations for future conservation strategies based on the analysis results.

### Conclusion:
- Summarize the importance of preserving endangered species in national parks and the role of data analysis in informing conservation efforts.
- Reflect on the significance of the project findings and potential implications for wildlife conservation policies.
